            <h2>My name is Dominique and living the simple life saved my life through God's light</h2>
            <p><strong>I used to be lost.</strong> I had so many things that i thought that i loved, but the truth was i couldn't even appreciate any of it
                 because there were too much.
                 <br>
            </p>
            <p>But then light broke forth to what it is today</p>
            <h3>How i turned things around</h3>
            <p><strong>I was on the verge of a breakdown when i lost what matters alot to me</strong> then God came through.
                I won't go through a lot of details but once i received the holy spirit everything became stress free, i found myself 
                getting things without stress. indeed God is life.
            </p>
            <h3>Now I live the simple life</h3>
            <p>Now that i am living  a simple life, things are so much better . I'm less stressed, enjoy life and work more, and i have more
                free rest to enjoy.
             </p>
             <p>With how much it turned my life around. <strong>I felt i had no choice but to start sharing how i did it.</strong> 
                and how others can benefit from the holy spirit living a simple life as well, which is why i started this site.
